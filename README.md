# iPod-Syncer-Bundle
A bundle that allows you to sync small pieces of information to older iPods. Apple no longer officially supports syncing Contacts, Notes, and Calendars. This bundle so far contains an app that syncs contacts and an app that syncs notes. I am working on calendars.

Latest version: 1.0
Download here:


Requirements:
macOS 10.13 or later
iPod Classic/Nano/Mini (Touches are not supported)
iCloud account (iPod Notes Syncer needs your notes to be stored in iCloud)

To install:
1. Download the disk image.
2. Drag the folder (shows an iPod syncing) to the Applications folder alias. Your Mac may ask for your password, enter it if prompted. The app will now be in your Applications folder. You will be able to open this folder to access the apps inside.

To use iPod Contacts Syncer:
1. Make sure your iPod is connected and its main disk volume (formatted to MacOS Extended) is called iPod HD. If not, change it in Disk Utility.
2. Launch the app. If it asks for permissions, allow it. It may ask multiple times for different folders and contacts.
3. Empty the trash. (The app created some temp files in a folder and trashed the folder to clean up after itself)

To use the iPod Notes Syncer:
1. Make sure your iPod is connected.
2. Launch the app. Select the note(s) from the list you want to sync. Click on the "Ok" button when you are done.
3. Select the "Notes" folder on your iPod's disk. To do this, go to "iPod HD" tab under the Locations section in the Finder sidebar in the prompt box. Then, select (one click) on the Notes folder.
4. Force-quit the app. For some weird reason, the current version of the app doesn't quit by itself.

To clear the Notes folder:
1. Open Folder Eraser. It comes in the bundle. However, you can use the separate app if you installed it from my Github repository.
2. Select the "Notes" folder on your iPod's disk. Use step 3 in the guide on iPod Notes Syncer, but use the prompt given by Folder Eraser.
3. Click "Choose".
4. Empty the trash.
